AWS Amplify is a platform for developing robust and scalable mobile and Internet applications. Thanks to this platform, tasks such as user authentication, reliable storage of user data and metadata, selective provision of data access, machine learning integration, analysis of application metrics and server-side code execution are greatly simplified. Amplify covers the entire mobile application development workflow from version control and code testing to production deployment and scales easily as the business grows, allowing you to increase the number of users from thousands to tens of millions. Amplify's open source libraries and command line interface are part of the Amplify platform. In the plug-in interface, you can configure and create your own plug-ins.

# Advantages of Amplify

## Huge Latitude and Depth
Amplify takes advantage of the AWS cloud to build applications, so you get access to significantly more services and features in many of these services than on other mobile application development platforms. When the number of users of your application increases significantly, there is no need to switch to an industrial-level platform, as Amplify scales as your business grows. With Amplify, you can create on-demand applications that can handle millions of requests per second and hundreds of terabytes of data worldwide with a delay of about one microsecond.

## Development for any platform
Amplify is a comprehensive solution for the development and launch of mobile applications for Android and iOS systems on this platform, as well as on the Internet application development platforms React Native, React, Ionic, Angular, Javascript and Vue. This platform has everything you need for version control, automated code testing and production deployment of the application. For fast-growing Internet applications, Amplify is the only platform that combines the workflows of developing client and server parts.

## Simplified data handling
In Amplify, the process of accessing data proceeds flawlessly; there are no difficulties setting up technologies for working with multiple databases. You can easily integrate existing data sources, such as various relational and non-relational databases. Amplify allows you to use GraphQL to simplify data management, while this is not provided on other platforms. GraphQL allows you to accelerate the development of mobile applications and make them more interactive due to the ability to request and receive pieces of information from different sources in one network request. This saves the CPU and battery resources consumed by the application.

## Offline Sync
Amplify provides data storage on a device with the function of synchronizing with data stored on the server. All other platforms provide only caching of data on the device. While the device is offline, the application can query and record data locally thanks to Amplify. As soon as the device reconnects to the network, Amplify automatically synchronizes the local data with the data stored on the server and resolves any conflicts. With Amplify, you can create robust mobile applications that can withstand network outages, as well as real-time collaboration applications on multiple devices.

## Without server management
Amplify allows you to run server-side code that implements the functionality of the application, without the need to manage servers. You optimize costs because you pay only for the resources that you use, and you do not need to do server maintenance, install updates or backup, and applications gain high availability automatically.

## Effective Security Controls
Amplify provides much more effective security controls than other platforms. In Amplify, you can configure specific access controls for each user in the application. You can easily set up unified authentication with Amazon, Facebook and Google, as well as control access to specific data that certain users have access to.

# Capabilities
Amplify provides features such as authentication, analytics, APIs (GraphQL and REST), interactions, forecasting, PubSub, data storage, Push notifications and XR, with which you can create serverless applications with advanced capabilities based on AWS services.
