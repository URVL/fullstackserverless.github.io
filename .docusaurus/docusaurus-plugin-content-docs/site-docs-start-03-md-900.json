  "description": "[ES Lint plugin](https://eslint.org) - write your code more clean, tells where you are making mistakes, and generally itâ€™s good practice to work in a team so that everyone has everything one style - ES Lint will tell you which variables you donâ€™t use, where and which components you donâ€™t use, it shows syntax errors and where you don't put spaces correctly, where do you put semicolons, etc. That is, this is already a standard defect that you need to use in writing your code and this plugin will save you from many silly mistakes that you make when developing your application.",
